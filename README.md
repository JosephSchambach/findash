# FinDash README

## üåü Highlights
This repo contains the core framework for the FinDash app. Some of those core functionalities are: 
- SQL read and write methods
- S3 download and upload capabilities
- Asset price fetching and downloading
- Asset news fetching
- Databricks job sending for ETL

## Overview
FinDash is a framework written to store core functions of the project FinDash. For context, the project is a financial dashboard app that allows users to register, login, visualize asset prices with different visualizations (e.g. line graph, candlestock, etc), see a list of recent asset news, and do some basic predictions for the assets based on ARIMA, LSTM, and Regression models. 
### Author
I'm Joseph Schambach. I work as a software engineer for a start up that automates billing and intake processes for companies in the healthcare industry. I am building this project to showcase what I've learned about software, data engineering, and ML development. 

## Usage Instructions
This package is designed to be developer friendly. Once the context is initialized, using Pydantic models and class methods, the developer can trigger different types of events with a single line of code.
**Initializing Context**
```
from context.findash_context import FinDashContext

context = FinDashContext()
```
**Fetching Asset Price Data**
```
from models.yfinance_models import FetchAssetData, Asset

data = context.api.fetch(FetchAssetData(asset=Asset(asset='AAPL', period='1d', interval='1d'))
```
**Downloading Asset Price Data for Multiple Assets**
```
from models.yfinance_models import DownloadAssetData

data = context.api.fetch(DownloadAssetData(assets=['AAPL', 'MSFT', 'GOOG'], period='5d', interval='1d')
```
**Trigger Databricks Job Run**
```
from models.databricks_models import SendDataBricksJob, DatabricksJob

context.api.send(SendDataBricksJob(job=DatabricksJob(job_id=1234567))
```
The package uses YFinance for data fetching, which means it uses the same inputs for intervals and periods. 
- Intervals: 1m,2m,5m,15m,30m,60m,90m,1h,1d,5d,1wk,1mo,3mo
- Periods: 1d,5d,1mo,3mo,6mo,1y,2y,5y,10y,ytd,max

Assets are any valid ticker that YFinance stores. This can be stocks, ETFs, and crypto currencies. 

## Installation Instructions
To install the FinDash package, you can download the .tar.gz file from the resources section and then run: 
```
pip install <<download_name>>
```
This will then allow you to import context and other modules as needed. 

## Configuration
In order to use the FinDash framework, you will need to have specific environment variables that the context can use to initialize. These configurations allow it to access AWS, SQL, and Databricks. You can set up your environment variables as such. 
```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY=<<AWS ACCESS KEY>>
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<<AWS SECRET ACCESS>>
AWS_REGION=<<AWS REGION NAME>>
USERNAME=<<SQL USERNAME>>
PASSWORD=<<SQL PASSWORD>>
SQL_TOKENS=<<STORED SQL TOKENS IN SECRETS MANAGER>>
DATABRICKS_TOKENS=<<STORED DATABRICKS TOKENS IN SECRETS MANAGER>>
```
